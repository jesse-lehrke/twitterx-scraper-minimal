 Minimal selenium-wire based code for small scale Twitter/X collection

 Requires:
 Chrome
 
 Chromedriver for your Chrome verion (see: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
 
## Comments
 Currently no requirements.txt (code extracted from larger project and posted here only temporarily as a public service)
 
 Basically selenium-wire (and OpenSSL if not installed) and pandas should get you going (in addition to Chrome and Chromedriver of course)
